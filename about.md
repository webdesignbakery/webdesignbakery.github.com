I'm a developer who has fallen in love with Ruby. Like most developers I started out with PHP, with a little time spent working in Java, but prefer Ruby if I have the choice.

[EmployeeReferrals.com](http://employeereferrals.com/) is where I spend my time these days. It's a startup that my friends and I started a little over two years agao. We are trying to change the way that companies find employees. We think we've got a great product and love what we do everyday.

I had a blog on Posterous for a while but since that service closed I stopped blogging. I decided to resurrect the blog and try blogging again.
